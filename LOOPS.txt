* Why Use Loops?
----------------
When attempting to repeat code over and over again, it can be monotonous to retype or copy and paste the same code. Worse, inadvertent typos can cause errors in your program.

Consider an example where you want your code to print the all the numbers from 1 to 10. Without loops, this would look something like:

echo "1\n";
echo "2\n";
echo "3\n";
echo "4\n";
echo "5\n";
echo "6\n";
echo "7\n";
echo "8\n";
echo "9\n";
echo "10";

That’s a lot of typing! And what if you decide later you want to change it to add "The count is currently: " at the beginning of each statement? You would need to copy and paste that into 
every single line.

Luckily, most programming languages contain a feature, called loops, for repeating code automatically until certain conditions are met. Sometimes the repetition is referred to as 
iterating and each time the code is executed is considered an iteration. Loops can be used to reduce the number of lines of code while also making it much easier to modify later on.

PHP is no exception and offers several ways to repeat execution of a code block.

This lesson will cover the following PHP loop types:

while
do … while
for
foreach
Each of these loops contain conditions for stopping execution of the loop. Improper implementation of these conditions can cause an infinite loop and the computer will never stop 
executing your code block. On Codecademy, if it seems like your code is taking too long or never completes, consider refreshing the page and re-examining your loop structure.

* while
-------
The first PHP loop that we will cover is the while loop. This type of loop continues to iterate as long as its conditional is true.

This code outputs the numbers from 1-10, similar to the previous example:

$count = 1;
while ($count < 11)
{
  echo "The count is: " . $count . "\n";
  $count += 1;
}

The first time the interpreter encounters this code, it checks the condition. If it evaluates to TRUE, the code block is executed. It then checks the condition again, and if TRUE, 
executes the code block again. It continues in this fashion until the condition is FALSE.

In this example, the code within the curly braces ({}) executes while the conditional statement within the brackets ($count < 11) is still true. $count starts at a value of 1 so the 
conditional is true on the first iteration.

The variable $count is incremented by 1 during each iteration of the loop ($count += 1). When $count is equal to 11, the conditional is no longer true and the while loop terminates. Any 
code after this block is then executed.


index.php
---------
<?php
$count = 1;
while ($count < 100) 
{
  if($count % 33 === 0) {
    echo $count . " is divisible by 33\n";
  }
  $count++;
};
